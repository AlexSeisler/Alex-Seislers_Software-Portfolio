# ACS Results (Student Portfolio SaaS)

### **Trigger / Need**

- Originated from Alex‚Äôs **own job search**: everyone said ‚Äúyou need a portfolio.‚Äù
- Built his own ‚Üí peers said, *‚ÄúThis is really good, can you make me one?‚Äù*
- Noticed a clear gap: **vocational/blue-collar students** were forced to rely on resumes that didn‚Äôt showcase the **visual nature of their work** (e.g. architecture, remodeling).

---

### **Ownership / Business Role**

- Launched as Alex‚Äôs **first entrepreneurship project**.
- Started with 3 pilot users (1 remodeling student, 2 architecture students).
- Ran a **campus campaign**: posters, QR codes, demo portfolios (including Alex‚Äôs remodeling work). Reached hundreds of students.
- Built a list of **25 interested peers** ‚Üí onboarded and trained 2 classmates to help fulfill demand.
- Negotiated with **college leadership (president + VP)** for on-campus approval.
- Worked with **career services + business professor (Dr. L)** to scope turning it into a full college service.
- Career services wanted to hire Alex **full-time to run it for students**, but Alex envisioned scaling it **beyond just one school**.

---

### **Tech Build**

- Iterated from **basic HTML templates** ‚Üí **React + Supabase + Stripe SaaS** with tiered pricing.
- Created **template portfolios** to show different trades (remodeling, architecture, software).
- CI/CD pipeline via Netlify for fast deployment.
- Designed for quick onboarding ‚Üí individual student portfolio setup in hours, not days.

---

### **Outcomes**

- Delivered **22+ live student portfolios**.
- Generated **$1K+ SaaS revenue** through tiered pricing.
- Secured **10 referral letters from employers** validating that portfolios improved hiring chances.
- Built credibility: invited to lead entrepreneurship events (led directly to ColumbiaPA300 opportunity).
- First experience with **IP ownership issues**:
    - School wanted Alex to run it ‚Äúfor them.‚Äù
    - He insisted on private LLC so he could scale to other schools.
    - Clash ‚Üí school shut down official partnership, forcing Alex to pivot.

---

### **Future Leverage**

- Proved that vocational/visual students want portfolio SaaS.
- Validated **repeatable business model**: template-based SaaS, campus campaigns, Stripe billing.
- Lessons:
    - Early adoption and ROI don‚Äôt matter if **ownership/IP isn‚Äôt aligned**.
    - Don‚Äôt lock into one institution if the vision is multi-market.
    - Sparked Alex‚Äôs **pivot into ACS Results AI** (bigger markets, automation tools).

# üéôÔ∏è Story-Mode Narrative (Interview)

> ‚ÄúACS Results was my first entrepreneurial project. I was building my own portfolio for job applications, and my peers started asking me to make them one too. At first it was just a simple one-pager, but then I realized vocational students ‚Äî carpenters, remodelers, architects ‚Äî had no way to showcase their work visually. So I turned it into a SaaS. I piloted with three students, then ran a campus campaign with QR codes and templates. Within weeks I had 25 students signed up and onboarded two classmates to help me build. Career services even wanted to hire me to run it full-time, and I got 10 local employers to vouch that student portfolios would increase hireability. But when it came down to ownership, the school wanted it for themselves. I had already set up an LLC to scale to other colleges, and that clash shut the whole partnership down. I still delivered 22 portfolios and generated $1K in revenue, but more importantly it taught me the business side: ownership, scaling vision, and the limits of working under an institution. It was my first real founder story ‚Äî and it pushed me to pivot into bigger markets with ACS Results AI.‚Äù

# ACS Results AI (Automation SaaS / Agency)

- The **transition from student/portfolio SaaS** into a **market-facing AI Automation Agency**.
- The spark: building **CIAN** ‚Üí mentor/connection said ‚Äúniche it into an agency.‚Äù
- The model: **ACS Results AI** ‚Üí bundling Chatbots, CallBots, Lead Gen, Websites into one agency play.
- Early traction: **John (startup helper)** ‚Üí website + chatbot + automated lead gen campaign ‚Üí 500 outreach ‚Üí 4 clients in 3 weeks.
- Other clients: RougeStoryBookWorld (site + campaign), ACS Results itself (agency showcase).
- Turning point: realized you wanted to **own full-stack skills**, not just rely on automation tools ‚Üí pivoted away to deeper engineering.
- Business limitation: lead gen campaigns worked but dried up without fresh lists ‚Üí lacked sustainability.

Let‚Äôs run this through the **structured framework** and then wrap it in a **story-mode version** for interviews/CLs.

# üìå ACS Results AI (Automation SaaS / Agency)

### **Trigger / Need**

- Came after **ACS Results (portfolio SaaS)** ‚Äî Alex needed to **transition into bigger markets**.
- Built **CIAN (Centralized Intelligence Automation Network)** as a first AI product ‚Üí through a startup connection from that project, was advised to **niche into AI Automation as a service offering**.
- Sparked ACS Results AI ‚Üí packaged automation into an agency model where skills were scarce and demand was high.

---

### **Ownership / Business Role**

- Founded ACS Results AI as an **automation agency**.
- Offered bundled services: **Chatbots, CallBots, Website builds, Automated Lead Gen**.
- Handled everything end-to-end: scoping, building, onboarding clients, and running campaigns.
- Early clients acquired through **personal startup connections + outbound freelancing**.

---

### **Tech Build**

- Website showcase (ACSResultsAI) to present services.
- **Automation stack:**
    - Voiceflow / Voiceglow ‚Üí chatbots.
    - Vapi + Bland.AI ‚Üí call bots.
    - Instantly.ai + Make.com ‚Üí automated lead gen (cold email + DM).
    - Supabase stubs + React frontend for SaaS demos.
- Built campaigns + integrated automation tools directly into client-facing sites.

---

### **Outcomes**

- **Client 1 (John, startup helper):** website + chatbot + automated lead gen ‚Üí 500+ outreach list ‚Üí **4 new clients in 3 weeks**.
- **Client 2 (RougeStoryBookWorld):** website + prepared lead gen ‚Üí execution stalled due to client‚Äôs lack of business readiness.
- **Client 3 (ACS Results AI itself):** agency showcase site + campaigns.
- Maintained John for several months, but lead flow dried up without new lists.
- Total: 3+ agency projects delivered, validating model but showing limits of lead-gen dependency.

---

### **Future Leverage**

- Playbook created: **AI Automation as an SMB agency service** (lead gen + bots + websites).
- Proof: real ROI (4 clients in 3 weeks), demand validated by startup connections.
- Weakness: sustainability relied on **constant new lead lists + clients ready to execute**.
- Strategic pivot: shifted from ‚ÄúAI tools do it for me‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúI want to own the full-stack engineering myself‚Äù ‚Üí catalyst for becoming a **founder + full-stack engineer**.
- Lessons: AI tools can drive short-term ROI, but **enduring leverage comes from building the platform itself, not just delivering automation as a service**.

---

# üéôÔ∏è Story-Mode Narrative (Interview)

> ‚ÄúACS Results AI was my first real external business model after building student portfolio sites. It came out of my first AI product, CIAN. Through that, a startup contact told me, ‚ÄòNiche this down and sell it as automation.‚Äô So I spun up ACS Results AI ‚Äî an agency offering chatbots, callbots, websites, and automated lead generation. My first client was John, a startup helper. I built him a website, integrated a chatbot, and ran a lead-gen campaign to his list of 500 contacts. Within three weeks, he had four new clients. I went on to deliver a site and campaign for RougeStoryBookWorld, and used ACS Results AI itself as a showcase. The business proved the demand ‚Äî but it also showed the limits. Without fresh lead lists, campaigns dried up. That‚Äôs when I realized I wanted to go deeper. Rather than just configuring tools, I wanted to own the full-stack and build platforms myself. ACS Results AI gave me my first taste of external ROI, but it also lit the fire that pushed me fully into being a founder and a systems engineer.‚Äù

# ColumbiaPA300 (Civic SaaS)

### **Trigger / Need**

- Spark came indirectly: Alex was asked to **lead an entrepreneurship event** at his college by alumni coordinator Beth Valentine, based on reputation from ACS Results (student portfolio SaaS).
- At that event, Alex connected with **Manny Ortiz**, an alumni business owner and community organizer.
- Manny had ties to the Borough of Columbia (already running their social media for the 300th anniversary). He needed someone to handle the **technical build side**.
- The borough was already planning a **logo contest with local schools** for their 300-year banner ‚Üí Alex proposed digitizing the process into a civic SaaS to **scale submissions, voting, and engagement**.

---

### **Ownership / Business Role**

- Entered through a **partnership with Manny** (he handled social; Alex handled all tech + product execution).
- Negotiated with borough organizers, scoped the project to digitize logo submissions, voting, donations, and civic media archiving.
- Delivered under **contracted work** ‚Üí Alex was paid for ColumbiaPA300 but ran into issues with **delayed payments** as Manny‚Äôs broader ‚Äúcharity positioning‚Äù collapsed.
- Attempted to **bridge the business model** by pitching local sponsorships, merch, and upsells ‚Äî but borough funding channel fell apart.

---

### **Tech Build**

- Built ColumbiaPA300 platform in **one weekend MVP**, then iterated with borough feedback.
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Router DOM.
- **Backend:** Netlify Functions; Stripe (donations), Airtable (votes/submissions), Google Drive (file storage), Slack (alerts).
- **Features:** logo submissions, structured voting rounds, media uploads, real-time Slack notifications, donation checkout, civic storytelling pages.

---

### **Outcomes**

- **Week 1:** 25 logo submissions + dozens of media uploads; hundreds of site visitors.
- **Week 2:** 1,000+ visitors; 5,000+ social media engagements via integrated campaigns.
- **Final impact:**
    - 100+ active residents engaged.
    - 170+ votes cast, banner logo chosen for borough.
    - $1,500+ in Stripe donations processed.
    - Campaign reach: 5.8K+ views / 2.1K unique reach on social.
- Delivered real, measurable community engagement and civic adoption.

---

### **Future Leverage**

- ColumbiaPA300 validated the **template for civic SaaS**: submissions + voting + donations + media + storytelling.
- Could be **white-labeled for other boroughs, schools, or civic events**.
- Playbook: quick MVP (weekend build), fast iteration with stakeholders, integrations that **prove trust (Stripe, Airtable, Slack)**.
- Lessons:
    - Tech validated ‚Üí adoption was real.
    - Business execution failed due to partner mismanagement (charity framing, lack of sustainable revenue).
    - If controlled end-to-end, this model could have scaled into a repeatable civic SaaS offering.

---

# üéôÔ∏è Story-Mode Narrative (Interview)

> ‚ÄúColumbiaPA300 started through my college network. I was leading an entrepreneurship event, and one of the alumni, Manny Ortiz, approached me about the Borough of Columbia‚Äôs 300th anniversary. They had a logo contest running with local schools, but everything was manual. Manny was running their social media, so he brought me in to handle the tech side. In one weekend, I spun up the first version of the platform: submissions, media uploads, and donations. By the second week, we had over 1,000 visitors, 5,000 social engagements, and 25+ logo submissions. We worked with the borough directly to refine it and launched live voting ‚Äî which pulled in 170+ votes and selected the official banner logo for the borough. On the business side, I even pitched sponsorships and local business upsells, but the borough‚Äôs funding collapsed because Manny had positioned the whole project as charity. That killed the long-term deal, but the platform itself worked. It proved a civic SaaS template could be spun up fast, adopted by real communities, and generate donations and engagement. It‚Äôs one of those projects where the tech succeeded, the adoption was real, but the business partner‚Äôs framing limited the upside.‚Äù

# AI Dev Federation + SMMAA

# üìå SMMAA (Social Media Marketing Automation Agency)

### **Trigger / Need**

- A larger client contracted Alex to build a **production-level SMMA SaaS platform** in just **6 weeks**.
- Scope: full agency-grade automation system for managing social media content and campaigns.
- Challenge: as a **solo developer**, Alex needed to deliver the output of an entire team.

### **Ownership / Business Role**

- Operated under a **direct contract build** with the client.
- Handled product scoping, architecture, and MVP delivery schedule.
- Set up early demos for client review, intended to close into longer-term SaaS rollout.

### **Tech Build**

- Architected **5 AI Automation Tools** for development speed: agents for planning, execution, and repo navigation.
- These internal tools boosted Alex‚Äôs throughput to ‚Äúteam-level productivity.‚Äù
- Within **4 weeks**, the SMMAA SaaS was scaffolded and demo-ready.

### **Outcomes**

- However, **client funding collapsed** ‚Üí project did not move forward commercially.
- Tools built for SMMAA development became **the foundation of a new product direction (AI Dev Federation)**.

### **Future Leverage**

- The stubbed SMMAA product remains viable for future **white-label licensing to SMMA owners**.
- Learnings from this contract ‚Üí demonstrated ability to deliver agency SaaS in accelerated timelines.
- Realized the **dev-side tooling** was more broadly valuable than the client-specific build.

---

# üìå AI Dev Federation (Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform)

### **Trigger / Need**

- Born as a **pivot from SMMAA**: the productivity tools Alex built for himself proved valuable beyond a single contract.
- Goal: validate these tools as a **standalone product for engineers**.

### **Ownership / Business Role**

- Created **AI Dev: Trifecta community** to onboard early users (3 engineers from Alex‚Äôs network).
- Built a **roadmap + Skool community** for structured adoption.
- Reframed from ‚Äúagency SaaS contract‚Äù ‚Üí **developer productivity SaaS**.
- Future: scale via **lead-gen campaigns**, expand adoption, and evolve into enterprise or white-label orchestration platforms.

### **Tech Build**

- Agents:
    - CIAN (GM) ‚Äì validates + routes.
    - System Architect ‚Äì DAGs + planning.
    - Security Architect ‚Äì integration checks.
    - DevBot ‚Äì repo changes + patch cycle.

### **Outcomes**

- Tools gave Alex **10√ó solo productivity** (enabled SMMAA MVP in 4 weeks).
- Onboarded **3 pilot engineers** into community, validated across live CI/CD workflows.
- Demonstrated **85% cycle-time reduction** from design ‚Üí deployment.
- Established as **portfolio flagship + recruiter demo asset**.

### **Future Leverage**

- White-label orchestration systems for **SMMA owners** (parallel to SMMAA).
- Developer-focused SaaS ‚Üí productivity accelerators for software teams.
- Extensible architecture: add new agents, expand integrations (GitHub, Hugging Face, LangChain).
- Positioned as a **‚Äúcompany-in-a-box‚Äù orchestration framework**, with community validation layer.

# üéôÔ∏è Story-Mode Narrative (Combined)

> ‚ÄúSMMAA was originally a contract build. A client wanted a production-grade Social Media Marketing Automation SaaS, and I had six weeks to deliver it solo. To keep pace, I built myself five automation tools that effectively gave me a full engineering team‚Äôs throughput. By week four, I had a live MVP demo, but the client‚Äôs funding fell through. That could have been the end of it ‚Äî but those tools had changed the way I worked. They made me 10√ó faster. So instead of shelving them, I pivoted and productized them as AI Dev Federation. I onboarded three engineers from my network, built a Skool community, and validated the system by running live CI/CD pipelines together. The results spoke for themselves: an 85% reduction in cycle times, and engineers telling me they felt like they suddenly had a team around them. SMMAA may have stalled, but it sparked something bigger ‚Äî a reusable, multi-agent orchestration layer that‚Äôs now my flagship platform and community hub.‚Äù
